This dashboard was designed to represent actual performance of students during studying at online school. Initial implementation got data from google sheets, combined and built its visual representation on the fly. So that the user could get the most recent and relevant information. But actually it took about 40 - 50 sec to get data from google sheets so this approach was abandoned.

Currently heroku server only serves pre-made and not very relevant json file. All redundant code is still in the repo.

Deployed client can be found [here](https://anton23kirienko.github.io/mentor-github/index.html).
